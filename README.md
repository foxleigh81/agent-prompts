# agent-prompts

A selection of agents that I use for my workflow. These are not the full agent files as it's best to use Claude to generate the agents, but this is a selection of the prompts I used to generate those agents.

## Usage

These prompts are intended to be used with Claude to generate custom agents that can assist with various development tasks. Each prompt provides the foundation for creating a specialized agent tailored to specific workflow needs.
